How to setup Kerberos Authentication on Local Ansible Controller(Linux server)

Step-by-step guide:
1. Provision a linux server and windows server and make sure they are in the same domain.
NOTE: Make sure you run the powershell script below after provisioning windows server to allow WinRM connections and enable PS Remoting inorder to authenticate from Ansible controller which is a linux machine.
Link to PowerShell script: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/examples/scripts/ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1

2. The krb5.conf file is the Kerberos configuration file and this is by default configured after installing krb5-workstation on your domain.

3. Run the commands below to install python-kerberos dependencies and python-kerberos wrapper
Run the following commands:
# Via Yum yum -y install python-devel krb5-devel krb5-libs krb5-workstation
# Via Apt (Ubuntu) sudo apt-get install python-dev libkrb5-dev krb5-user
# python-kerberos wrapper pip install pywinrm[kerberos]
# problems with pip? run the commands below For yum: sudo yum group install "Development Tools" sudo yum install python-setuptools sudo easy_install pip

For apt-get
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-dev build-essential sudo easy_install pip

4. Edit your krb5.conf and make the changes as specified below.
Run the following commands:
sudo vi /etc/krb5.conf
# under [libdefaults], change the value of "dns_lookup_realm" and "dns_lookup_kdc" from false to true

5. [realms] and [domain_realm] are by default configured in the krb5.conf file. You don't need to add anything to it unless the remote server is not part of your domain

6. Now, run the command below to test if you're authorised by your domain controller.
kinit username@MY.DOMAIN.COM
# To display the details of what kerberos tickets you have acquired, run klist

7. If the above command "kinit username@MY.DOMAIN.COM" didn't create a kerberos ticket, that means you are using an alias. Run the command below to check if you're using a fully qualified domain name.
kinit -C user@MY.DOMAIN.COM klist

8. Once the ticket is created, use the win-ping module to test the connection from linux to windows server.
Run the following commands:
# ansible -m win_ping (Note: Run this only if you have the hostname added to you hosts file, else you can add your inventory path in the ansible.cfg file)
# ansible <FQDN/IP ADDRESS> -m win_ping

9. Upon successful authentication, run the sample playbook to copy a text file from local machine to remote server.
Run the following commands:
# ansible playbook -i <path/to/hosts/file> site.yaml
